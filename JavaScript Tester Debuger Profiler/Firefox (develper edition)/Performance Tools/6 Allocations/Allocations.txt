Allocations  分配

The allocations view periodically samples allocations that are made over the recording. Each row represents a function in which at least one allocation-sample was taken during the recording.

分配视图对记录中的内存分配情况进行周期取样。每一行表达了某个函数的至少一个样本的内存分配情况

It includes the following columns:

	Self Count: the number of allocation-samples that were taken in this function (also shown as a percentage of the total)
	
	Self Bytes: the total number of bytes allocated in the allocation-samples in this function (also shown as a percentage of the total)

	Self Cost: "Self" records samples taken only in this function. 

	Total Cost: "Total" records samples taken in this function or in functions called by this function.
