basic syntax

Script Tag

	<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
	   JavaScript code
	</script>

Whitespace and Line Breaks

	JavaScript ignores spaces, tabs, and newlines that appear in JavaScript programs.

Semicolons are Optional

	Simple statements in JavaScript are generally followed by a semicolon character, just as they are in C, C++, and Java. JavaScript, however, allows you to omit this semicolon if each of your statements are placed on a separate line.

Case Sensitivity

	JavaScript is a case-sensitive language.

Comments in JavaScript

	// 

	/*     */

	<!--  (same as //)     

	//-->
