null and undefined

null is a language keyword that evaluates to a special value that is usually used to indicate the absence of a value. null can be thought of as a special object value that indicates “no object”.

The undefined value represents a deeper kind of absence. It is the value of variables that have not been initialized and the value you get when you query the value of an object property or array element that does not exist.
